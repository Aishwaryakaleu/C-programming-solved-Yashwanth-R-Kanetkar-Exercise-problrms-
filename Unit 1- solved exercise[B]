[B] Point out the errors, if any, in the following C statements

(a) int = 314.562 * 150 ; = C keyword is used as variable name. 

(b) name = ‘Ajay’ ; = Char can only store 1 character.Also only single sided single quotes are used to enclose char.

(c) varchar = ‘3’ ; = only single sided single quotes are used to enclose char.

(d) 3.14 * r * r * h = vol_of_cyl ; = One and only one variable can be at the left side of an expression.

(e) k = ( a * b ) ( c + ( 2.5a + b ) ( d + e ) ; = It is assumed that arithmetic operators (*) are already present. When they are not

(f) m_inst = rate of interest * amount in rs ; = No spaces are allowed in c variable names.

(g) si = principal * rateofinterest * numberofyears / 100 ; = No error 

(h) area = 3.14 * r ** 2 ; = (*) is repeated      

(i) volume = 3.14 * r ^ 2 * h ; = There is no exponential operator in C.

(j) k = ( (a * b ) + c ) ( 2.5 * a + b ) ; = A single variable can not store more than one values.

(k) a = b = 3 = 4 ; = A single variable can not store more than one values.

(l) count = count + 1 ; = No error
